﻿# ﻿Python quick learning guideI am coming from C#, JavaScript, Node background. And recently got a chance to work on an existing Machine Learning project written in Python. The challenge was to learn Machine Learning concepts with a new language. At first Python looked easy due to its simple syntax. Below are few links which helped me to understand the language -- [http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/](http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/)- [https://www.guru99.com/python-tutorials.html](https://www.guru99.com/python-tutorials.html)But, When it came to writing code I was kind of struggling due to lack of hands-on in Python. So, my approach was to learn the language with a fair hands on the basics and key concepts of the language before deep dive into the popular libraries like, numpy, pandas, sklearn, scipy, matplotlib etc..This repository will guide you through the step-by-step approach to learn this language. So, go though the codes file by file and practice to write and execute the code. In my case I used PyCharm but you are free to use anything you like. File name and it's order is important and recommend you to follow the same.  In most of the cases I have pasted the output next to the expression along with some key notes/concepts wherever possible.> Note: In your project don't ever try to add comments for what code is doing instead you should be capturing why you are writing a code block.Code can be downloaded from [python-practice](https://github.com/kumardh/python-practice). I am still working on this repository and will be updating this time to time. So stay tuned if you are interested.
